# Tanker information

## BLUEFOR

### ELINT Platforms
Two ELINT Platforms - ELINT1 and ELINT2 are spawnable - by default around Range 2 via the F10->other->Awacs Tanker and Elint control. When spawned, an Elint menu will be generated in the bottom of the F10-other menu which users can use to check-in and get coordiantes for specific sites on Range 2 primary.

Regardless of check-in with the SEAD Controller (VACUUM) - when active - it will provide alerting on Range 2 primary freq in the case of a popup threats.

Accuracies are given as follows:

Targetable is TLE CATII or better.
CAT 3 - 6 is high accuracy - suffxed by the category. e.g. "high accuracy CAT 3".
Anything outside CAT 6 is "accuracy low".

<br>

** Accuracy ** | TLE | ** meters **
-------------- | --- | ------------
Targetable | CAT1-2 | < 0.1 to 15
High accuracy | CAT3 | < 30
High accuracy | CAT4 | < 91
High accuracy | CAT5 | < 305 
Low accuracy | CAT6 | > 305

<br>
<br>

**SECTOR(s)** |  **FREQUENCY** |  **CALLSIGN** | ** WHAT**
 ------------ | ---------------| ------------- | -----------------------    
**RANGE2**    | 239.750        | VACUUM        | ALERT & Strike Control 
**RANGE2**    | 309.000        | N/A           | LOWDOWN

ELINT1 and ELINT2 are C17s with an embedded ESM suite, but these roles can be fillled by other units, depending on the mission at the time.
